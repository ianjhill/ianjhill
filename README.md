- 👋 Hi, My name is Ian Hill, @ianjhill. I am a recent 2022 graduate with <1 year of developer experience. I am actively being educated through the iOS community on social media as well as learning key concepts and development practices through online learning opportunities such as (“Hacking with Swift” Paul Hudson, Sean Allen teachable courses etc.). I am looking to gain a foot in the door of not only iOS, but programming and tech in general. I'm eager to gain experience through mentorships or continuing the process of learning and practicing project building online.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Swift/UI and plan on creating and contributing to projects as to deomstrate my iOS development skills to future employers.
- 💞️ I’m looking for entry-level opportunities that can jumpstart my career of becoming a reliable and confident software developer.
